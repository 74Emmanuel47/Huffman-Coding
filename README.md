# Huffman-Coding
The Huffman Coding is an algorithm used to compress data. The idea is to assign variable-length codes to input characters, lengths of the assigned codes are based on the frequencies of corresponding characters. In this repository we are goint to try to replicate this kind of coding using the C programming language.
